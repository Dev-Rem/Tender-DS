        A tender is a formal invitation to suppliers to submit bids for the
        supply of goods, services, or works, typically issued by a government or
        large organization. It serves as a competitive procurement process to
        ensure fairness and transparency, encouraging various vendors to present
        their best offers in terms of price, quality, and delivery. The
        tendering process usually involves several stages, including the
        publication of tender documents, submission of bids, evaluation of
        proposals, and the awarding of the contract to the most suitable bidder.
        This method helps organizations achieve the best value for money and
        promotes accountability in spending.
